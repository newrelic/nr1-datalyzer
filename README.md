# Datalyzer

![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-datalyzer?include_prereleases) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-datalyzer/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-datalyzer)

## Usage

Datalyzer provides a simple, curated way to explore your data within New Relic.

Users can create basic charts and queries, which can be run inside the Chart Builder. From the Chart Builder, you can change the chart type, change the query and add the chart to a dashboard.

Datalyzer can be accessed both globally, and in the context of a Service, Mobile or Browser application.

Using Datalyzer from a Service, Mobile or Browser application limits the events, metrics, attributes and dimensions to data reported by those entities.

> [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-prometheus-openmetrics-integration-kubernetes) and the [Metric API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/introduction-new-relic-metric-api).
> Traditional (nondimensional) metrics collected by older New Relic products are not currently supported.
